Practice management software is a bit like a Swiss army knife in terms of the sheer breadth of tools it combines. But even the most comprehensive practice management platform can’t do everything your accounting firm needs. To work effectively alongside other software platforms, you need to ensure seamless integration. 

In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about integrating [practice management software](https://blog.taxdome.com/?category=practice-management) with the rest of your accounting tech stack. 

**The importance of integrating with other tools**

According to a recent study, the average small business uses a whopping 172 apps. Without integration, those 172 apps are essentially hidden behind closed walls. They can’t connect to each other to share information or create user-friendly workflows. This is where integration comes in.

Integration allows you to connect all those disparate apps together to create a unified technology ecosystem. Instead of being siloed within each app, data can be shared among apps seamlessly, and processes involving multiple apps can be performed without jumping from one to another.

**The benefits of software integration**

Let’s take a deeper dive into the benefits of software integration, focusing on three key examples.

1 **Optimized workflows**

Accounting workflows often involve multiple software tools. The process of engaging and onboarding a new client might require you to use a scheduling app alongside your practice management platform, accounting software, and payment processor. Through integration, these different platforms can be part of one seamless process, allowing accountants to work more efficiently. 

2 **Improved data accuracy**

Because data is shared seamlessly between software systems, there’s no need for manual data entry. This reduces the risk of human error significantly, which can save your accounting firm all manner of problems down the line.

3 **Increased productivity**

With a joined-up tech stack, your accounting team will be able to work more efficiently than ever. All that time spent jumping from one platform to another is eliminated. As a result, technology goes from being a barrier to productivity to an accelerator.

**Key tools and systems to integrate with**

So what sort of tools can you integrate your practice management software with? In this section, we’ll look at some key examples. 

**Accounting and tax platforms**

Integrating with your accounting and tax platform ensures that important client data — such as contact details, invoices, and account-related information — is automatically synced between the two systems. It also ensures that client data is accurate and up-to-date across systems.

What’s more, integrating with your accounting software speeds up client onboarding. You can add new client data to your practice management platform’s CRM, and that data will automatically be added to your accounting system. 

**Billing and invoicing tools**

Most practice management software comes with built-in billing and invoicing tools, but if yours doesn't, or you think you can find better functionality in an external tool, this is an important option for integration.

**Payment providers**

By connecting your practice management software with a payment provider such as Stripe or CPACharge, you can engage clients, send invoices, and collect payments all in one place. This also makes for a seamless and hassle-free payment process for your clients, which makes them more likely to pay on time.

**Communication platforms**

Again, most practice management systems come with tools for both internal and external communication. [TaxDome](https://taxdome.com/), for example, provides a complete communication ecosystem, with synced email, secure chats, and two-way SMS. That said, the ability to connect to a platform like Slack, Teams, or WhatsApp may suit your firm and clients. 

**Scheduling apps**

If your platform has a client portal, integrating with scheduling apps such as Calendly can be a game-changer. By enabling clients to book appointments directly in the portal, both parties save time and hassle. 

**Government portals**

Some practice management platforms offer integrations with government portals. TaxDome, for example, allows you to integrate with the IRS (US) to download official client transcripts. You can also connect with Companies House (UK) to sync data related to companies, directors, and important dates. 

**Native integrations vs integration tools**

It’s worth noting that not all integrations are the same. Some are native integrations, where the practice management software connects directly to another app as a built-in feature. These integrations tend to be quick and easy to utilize — just a few clicks and you are done. 

Other integrations are via third-party tools such as Zapier or Make (formally Integromat), which act as connectors that allow two applications to “talk” to each other. This type of integration typically involves more technical steps and is therefore more prone to issues. The upside is that it allows you to connect to thousands of apps, vastly expanding your automation and interoperability capabilities.

**Conclusion**

When it comes to getting the most out of your practice management platform, integration is essential. By connecting to different software platforms, you can seamlessly share data, enhance workflows, and increase efficiency and accuracy.
